<p class="more first">
	Below is a detailed list of important fixes mainly for the new FORM tools. An upgrade is highly recommended. 
</p>

<a name="validator"></a>
<h2>Validator</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		Addded <samp>required</samp> attribute support for checkbox and select inputs. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/60/40480">listingwarebob</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
	<li>
		Improved email validation pattern that allows <samp>+</samp> sign to be used in the email. For example: foo+bar@gmail.com. Thanks <a href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/issues#issue/22">bhickey</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fixed a bug where validator could not be used directly with a group of inputs. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/60/40618">mjj</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
	<li>
		Removed the support for <samp>oninvalid</samp>- attribute on input fields. This required the use of <samp>eval()</samp> function in JavaScript which is concidered evil. Also modern browsers such as latest <strong>Chrome 5.0 Beta</strong> supports <samp>oninvalid</samp> attribute natively causing unpredictable results.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="dateinput"></a>
<h2>Dateinput</h2>	
	
<ol>
	<li>
		Ability to definie the initial value manually with the <samp>value</samp> property. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/70/40613">listingwarebob</a>.
	</li>	
	<li>
		Ability to prevent the calendar for being hidden by returning <samp>false</samp> from <samp>onHide</samp>. This allows you to display Dateinput statically so that it always visible. Here is a demo about <a href="/tools/demos/dateinput/static.html">static dateinput</a>. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/70/40780#post-40979">enminc</a> for the suggestion. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Removed support for <samp>valueAsDate</samp> DOM property. Latest browsers such as <strong>Chrome 5.0 Beta</strong> supports this attribute natively and does not allow the editing of this property. To make this library work similarly in all browsers this property had to be removed. 
		
		<p>
			In fact the support for this property caused the latest Chrome to fail. Thanks <a href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/issues#issue/24">bbangert</a> for the bug report.
		</p>
	</li>	
	<li>
		Fixed a bug in the month selector. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/70/40544">mbuckbee</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
	<li>
		Some special dates could not be displayed. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/70/40551">mcjiffy</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Rangeinput</strong> removed support for <samp>valueAsNumber</samp> DOM attribute due to the same reasons as <samp>valueAsDate</samp> attribute was removed from Dateinput.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Flashembed</strong> If no Flash is installed a version [0, 0] is returned. Previously an error was thrown in browsers without any Flash version. This is a very important fix.	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Slideshow plugin</strong> Fixed a bug where initial tab contents was not displayed on Webkit based browsers with external stylesheets. Thanks <a href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/issues#issue/25">ngosteli</a> for the bug report.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>All Tools</strong> Switched from jQuery version 1.4.1 to 1.4.2. There was an old version installed on CDN. Thanks to <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/20/40767">johndwells</a> for bringing this up.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Tooltip</strong> Fixed a bug where the configured layout was overridden with a <samp>html()</samp> call. Now <samp>append</samp> is used instead. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/30/40958">radarseven</a> for the bug report.
	<li>
		<strong>Scrollable</strong> <samp>getIndex()</samp> was returning negative numbers in circular looping. Now this is fixed and correct index number is returned. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/35/40706">m4olivei</a> for the bug report. 		
	</li>
</ol>
