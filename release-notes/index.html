		<h3>HTML5 Form validation</h3>
	
		<p>
			jQuery Tools brings form validation to the level that it should have been 20 years ago. It's compact, fast and builds upon the best parts of HTML5 and Web Forms 2.0 standards. Use the new HTML5 input types or create your own. Together with jQuery these complex standards can be turned into pure amazing.

		<h3>HTML5 date input for humans</h3>
	
		<p>
			Now you can use HTML5 date inputs on every modern browser in a consistent and standardized manner. Use CSS to do make skins that look like yours. Example skins are provided. Opera will render date input even if JavaScript is disabled.

			This tool brings HTML5 range input support for all browsers in a consistent and standardized manner <em>today.</em> The range field is just like any other form field that can be scripted and submitted. Opera and Safari will render range input even if JavaScript is disabled.

		A typical software project grows in time. Not jQuery Tools. It gets smaller! The UI tools are now <strgon>${v.jqtSize} kB</strgon> and the library is now hosted on Github.

		<h3>50% smaller Scrollable</h3>  
		
		<p>
			The New Scrollable let's you have a complete freedom in "page" desing. You can have variable amount of items on a single page and the items can have variable width. The circular plugin functionality is now build inside the scrollable and is no longer in beta. Infinite loops are now rock solid and you can even add new items in a circular scrollable without breaking it. The new navigator plugin allows you to browse between pages with browser back and forward buttons and the browser history also works for dynamically added items.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Above all you'll get all this with 3 kb. The smallest scrollable implementation on the web just got 45% smaller!

		<h3>Toolbox. Set of tiny web essentials.</h3>

		<p>
			Version 1.2.0 tightens the criteria for a Most Important User Interface Component for the Web. Flashembed and Expose are no longer one part the core UI tools. Instead they are now part of a Toolbox which is a collection of tiny essentials that offer additional goodies for the main tools. For example a Toolbox member <samp>history</samp> allows both tabs and scrollables to use browser's back button.
		</p>
	  
		<p>
			Each Toolbox member is also working as a standalone tool and there is no complex dependencies. Remember that this library is all about "Tools not Policy".  	
		</p>

		<h3>Smoother tooltips</h3>

		<p>
			Tooltip has undergone a rather significant rewrite on the logic. Just like scrollable the tool is now simpler and smaller but definitely zero compromises on the behaviour. On the contrary. This version has a dedicated tooltip for each trigger element making it possible to have a separate animation for them all. The tooltip element itself is autogenerated if not explicitly defined so you can simply write <samp>$(".mytrigger").tooltip();</samp> and that's it.

		<h3>Respecting jQuery community</h3>

		<p>
			Previous version had a handy configuratino variable <samp>api</samp> for accessing Tools programming API. Many people liked it but not all. After serious thinking I decided to drop it and go with the jQuery "community". Now you'll access the api with jQuery's <samp>data</samp> method. For example

		<h3>Github</h3>

		<p>
			There are two GitHub repositories: <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">jQuery Tools</a> and <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">Website</a>. With Github it's much easier to contribute to the project. I'm also just a contributor to it. Remember: It's about the code - not ego. And now with Github there is also a proper <a href="#">Bug Tracker</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you want to contribute please fork the project provide your changes to the Fork Queue. Of course I'm more than happy to discuss about the ideas before any coding starts. Please send your ideas by email trough Github. 
		</p>

		<h3>Closure Compiler</h3>

		<p>
			The combined size of the UI tools are now 3.95kB. Smaller code downloads faster and is easier to understand and use. File size is especially important in JavaScript libraries. Web is all about speed. The file size can be reduced mainly by writing better code but also by using a proper JavaScript minifier. By the time of writing Googles Closure Compiler generates smallest files.

		<h3>New copyleft policy</h3>

		<p>
			I generally don't like graffiti but a graffiti artist called Bansky <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/917press/2583620793/" class="external">makes a difference</a>. I copied his copyright statement which says: "Copyright is for loosers" - how true that is. Copyrights are there just to block innovative thinking and humane life. People need to start sharing instead of owning. Ideally this is how everything should work. Of course our capitalist world works the opposite way resulting poor quality such as SAP or IBM. In many cases thousands of people are exploited on the act of capitalism (Nike, Nestle, Nokia,  Chiquita). 
		</p>
		
		<h3>New versioning policy</h3>
		
		<p>
			Previously each individual tool had an own version number. Now there is only one version number: the version of the jQuery Tools. Every tool belong to a single jQuery Tools version. Simpler.
