		20 year wait is over. Now you can build your forms with HTML5 and make them look and behave like you want. This completely new set of tools weights only <strong>${v.jqtFormSize} kb</strong> and you load it from a free content delivery network.

		<h3>HTML5 Form validation</h3>
	
		<p>
			jQuery Tools brings form validation to the level that it should have been 20 years ago. It's compact, fast and builds upon the best parts of HTML5 and Web Forms 2.0 standards. Use the new HTML5 inputs or create your own. Together with jQuery these complex standards can be turned into pure amazing.

		<h3>HTML5 date input for humans</h3>
	
		<p>
			Now you can use HTML5 date inputs on all browsers. Use CSS to make skins that look and behave like you want. Example skins are provided. Opera will render date input even if JavaScript is disabled.

		<h3>HTML5 range input for us all</h3>
	
		<p>
			Range inputs simply makes your forms easier to use. Range input is just like any other form field that can be scripted and submitted. Opera and Safari will render range input even if JavaScript is disabled.

		<h2>jQuery TOOLS <span>1.2.0</span></h2>
	</div>
	
	<p class="punch">
		A typical software project grows in time. Not jQuery Tools. It gets smaller! Now the UI tools are just <strgon>${v.jqtSize} kB</strgon> and the sources are hosted on Github.
	</p>

		<h3>Smaller and smaller</h3>

		<p>
			In JavaScript file size is a very important quality measure. Web is all about speed. The combined size of Tabs, Tooltips, Overlay and Scrollable is now <strong>${v.jqtSize} kb</strong> when minified and gzipped. New tools are 20% smaller making it faster and easier to understand. The file size can be reduced by writing good code but also by using a proper JavaScript minifier. By the time of writing Googles Closure Compiler generates smallest files which is being used for jQuery Tools 1.2.0.

		<h3>Completely new Scrollable</h3>  
		
		<p>
			The new Scrollable gives you a complete freedom to "page" desing. Variable amount of items on a single page with variable width. The circular feature is now a core feature and it is no longer in beta. Infinite loops are now rock solid and you can even add new items in a circular scrollable without breaking it. You can navigate between pages with the browser's back button and the browser history also works for dynamically added items. All this with a rediculous <strong>0.98 kb</strong> file size. The smallest scrollable on the web is now 50% smaller!

		<h3>Toolbox. A set of small essentials.</h3>

		<p>
			jQuery Tools is a collection of the most important UI components for the Web. Version 1.2.0 tightens this criteria. Flashembed and Expose are no longer main tools. They are now part of a Toolbox which is a collection of small utilities that offer supporting features for the main tools. For example <samp>history</samp> allows both tabs and scrollables to use browser's back button.
		</p>
	  
		<p>
			All tools in the Toolbox also works as a standalone tool and there are no complex dependencies. Remember that this library is all about "Tools not Policy".  	
		</p>

		<div class="image"
			style="background-position:-594px -638px;margin-left:20px"></div>
			
		<h3>Smoother Tooltips</h3>

		<p>
			Tooltip has undergone a significant rewrite. Just like scrollable the tool is now simpler and smaller but definitely zero compromises on the behaviour. On the contrary. This version has a dedicated tooltip for each trigger making it possible to have a separate animation for each. The tooltip element itself is automatically generated if not explicitly defined so you can simply write <samp>$(".mytrigger").tooltip();</samp> and that's all.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">  
	
		<div class="image" style="background-position:-300px -950px;"></div>
			
		<h3>jQuery best practices</h3>

		<p>
			Now you can use <samp>bind</samp> method to assign event listeners and use <samp>data</samp> method to access the programming API. Both are well know practices for the jQuery community. You can still assign event listeners from the tools programming API. However the <samp>api</samp> configuration variable is now deprecated.

		<h3>Github</h3>

		<p>
			Two GitHub repositories exists: <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">jQuery Tools</a> and <a class="external" href="http://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools">Website</a>. Now it's easier to contribute. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you want to join the project please fork it and provide your changes to the Fork Queue. Please send your ideas by email trough Github. I'm more than happy to discuss about them before any coding starts.  
		</p>

		<h3 style="font-size:13px">NO COPYRIGHTS OR LICENSES. DO WHAT YOU LIKE.</h3>
		
		<p>
			This is the new jQuery Tools license. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Copyrights and patenst are evil. They block the natural progress. We all know it: if people start sharing instead of owning the world would be a better place. Today money is the king. This results closed systems and poor quality (SAP, IBM, Microsoft) and people are seriously exploited (Nike, Nestle, Nokia). For businessmen nothing is enough.

		<h3>New versioning policy</h3>
		
		<p>
			Previously each individual tool had an own version number. Now there is only one version number: the version of the jQuery Tools. Every tool belong to a single jQuery Tools version. Simpler.
