jQuery Tools website
-----------------------

Tomcat/Java/JSP

Version 1.2.0 will still be hosted under flowplayer.org. Flowplayer kindly sponsors 
this project so we can buy things like Graphics and Freelance code.

A password protected development server is at

http://dev.flowplayer.org 

(Jan 2010)


jquerytools.org (1.3.0)
------------------------

nginx/nodejs

This future version of the website is build with future technologies. http://nodejs.org is
a powerfull JavaScript webserver (among other things). A perfect choise for this project.
We hope that it matures and has a solid template engine when the technology switch happens.
If not PHP or Ruby will be used. These are better choises for open source projects than Java.
