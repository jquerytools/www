	For maximum safety we suggest that you encode special characters with corresponding HTML entities. There are many lists on the web. I used <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/latin1.html" class="external">this one</a>.

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
