	Put focus on following input element either by mouse or with keyboard's tab key and you'll see a calendar control. You can navigate between days with your arrow keys or with <strong>VIM</strong> keyboard shortcuts. <samp>Page UP/DOWN</samp> navigates between months and <samp>Enter</samp> selects the day. <samp>Home</samp> key will navigate to the current day.

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>
	Here is all code for the above.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- include jQuery FORM Tools (or any other combination) -->
<script src="http://cdn.jquerytools.org/${v.jqt}/form/jquery.tools.min.js"></script>

<!-- dateinput styling -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dateinput.css"/>

<!-- HTML5 date input -->
<input type="date" name="mydate" />

<!-- make it happen -->
<script>
$(":date").dateinput();
</script>
</pii:code>

<p>
	The HTML5 date input is now powered with jQuery Tools cross browser dateinput that can be skinned with CSS. If user is using a browser that supports date inputs the input field's type is changed to <samp>text</samp> so that the native version is not disturbing us. It is only being displayed if JavaScript is disabled. 
</p>

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3>Skinning with CSS</h3>

<p>
	Here we use following <a href="css/skin1.css">CSS file</a> for the look and feel of the calendar control. Take a look at the <a href="${jqt}/dateinput/index.html#skinning">skinning documentation</a> to understand how it works. 
</p>
