	This demo shows some of the capabilities in lazyload. The progress indicator has been styled with css (simple yellow), the element's style is changed while it is loading and we have used two callback methods <samp>onLoad</samp> and <samp>onLoadAll</samp> to perform some animation.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Our HTML setup is identical to the <a href="loaders.html">previous demo</a>. We load an image, background image and a HTML DIV
</p>


<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	The names of the class names can be changed from the <a href="${jqt}/toolbox/lazyload.html#configuration">configuration</a>. 
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	<samp>onLoad</samp> is triggered every time an element has been loaded. <samp>onLoadAll</samp> is triggered after <strong>all</strong> elements returned by the jQuery selector are loaded.
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Enclosing your call inside <samp>$(document).ready</samp> executes the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/index.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
