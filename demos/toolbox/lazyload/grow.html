	Lazyload has a build-in grow effect which causes the wrapper element to grow once the element has been loaded. The dimensions are either image or the loaded DIV dimensions. This feature allows you to build interesting features to your JavaScript applications. Think of loazyloaded and growing slideshows, tooltips or overlays.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	We have three DIV's with a background image.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<div id="loadables">
	<div style="background-image:url(image1.jpg)"></div>	
	<div style="background-image:url(image2.jpg)"></div>	
	<div style="background-image:url(image3.jpg)"></div>	
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>

</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Enclosing your call inside <samp>$(document).ready</samp> executes the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/index.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.

<div class="box petrol">
	Here is the <a href="grow.html">standalone version</a> of this demo. You can freely study and copy its source code.
