	Lazyload is capable of loading images, background images and HTML elements. Here we have an example of all of these types. Click on the "load assets" button.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Images and background images are defined normally. Background images could have been defined via external stylesheet also and they will be lazyloaded too. If you want to lazyload HTML the syntax can be seen from the third element. It is a wrapper element (typically DIV) enclosed with a single anchor tag where the loaded page is specified in <samp>href</samp> attribute. This is standard HTML and is viewable by search engines and JavaScript disabled browsers too.

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>

</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Enclosing your call inside <samp>$(document).ready</samp> executes the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/index.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
